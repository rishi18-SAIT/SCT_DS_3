Task3 -Decision Tree Classifier 

📊 Task 03 – Decision Tree Classifier using Bank Marketing Dataset
This project is part of my SkillCraft Data Science Internship. The goal is to build a Decision Tree Classifier that predicts whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data.

📁 Dataset
We use the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains information related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.

✅ Key Features:
Age
Job
Marital status
Education
Default
Balance
Housing loan
Personal loan
Contact communication type
Last contact day/month/duration
Previous campaign outcomes

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python
Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation
Scikit-learn – Model building
Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
Jupyter Notebook

✅ Task Objectives
Load and explore the dataset.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key patterns.
Preprocess the data: handle nulls, encode categorical features, scale if necessary.
Train a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the y (target) column.
Evaluate the model using metrics like:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
Confusion Matrix

📈 Output

Trained Decision Tree Model
Classification Report

Feature Importance Graph

Visualized Decision Tree (optional)

📌 Conclusion
This task demonstrates the ability to use decision trees for classification problems and provides insights into which features most influence customer purchasing decisions.
